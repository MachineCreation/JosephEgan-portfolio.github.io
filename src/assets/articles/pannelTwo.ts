Python is my go-to for backend development—its simplicity and versatility make it perfect for creating scalable, maintainable solutions across different areas. For frontend work, I prefer typeScript, especially when it comes to building engaging user interfaces using frameworks like React and Vite.js. TypeScript adds another layer to my workflow, with its static typing and powerful tools that help ensure code quality and make collaboration smoother, especially on larger projects."
